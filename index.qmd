I'm Mike, a quantitative biologist with a background in evolutionary theory, population dynamics, and quantitative methods for studying microbiomes.
Since early 2022, I have served as the scientific lead for the [Nucleic Acid Observatory (NAO) project](https://www.naobservatory.org/), first at MIT and now at [SecureBio](https://www.securebio.org).
The NAO is a collaboration between SecureBio and [Kevin Esvelt's Sculpting Evolution group](https://sculptingevolution.org/) at MIT which is developing new methods to detect future pandemics.

From 2017--2022, I was a Postdoc with [Ben Callahan](https://callahanlab.cvm.ncsu.edu) at NC State University, where I worked on methods to improve the accuracy and reproducibility of microbiome measurements.

Prior to that (2010--2016), I did a Ph.D. in Biology under [Marcus W. Feldman](https://www-evo.stanford.edu/marc.html), in which I developed mathematical theory to describe evolutionary dynamics in spatially structured populations.

In my undergraduate studies (2005--2009), I studied mathematics, logic, and physics at the University of Pennsylvania.
During that time, I worked in the [Devlin Lab](http://web.sas.upenn.edu/devlinlab/) on several telescope projects, spending 4 months at the [Atacama Cosmology Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atacama_Cosmology_Telescope) after graduation.
